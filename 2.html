            Earth, holy and inexhaustible, is graven
            With shining furrows where his plows have gone, they facilitate year after year, the timeless labor of venture capitalists.
            
        <p>
                [Antistrope 1] 
            The lightboned birds and beasts that cling to cover, 
            The lithe fish lighting their reaches of dim water, All are taken, tamed in the net of his mind;
            The lion on the hill, the wild horse windy-maned, Resign to him; and his blunt yoke has broken The sultry shoulders of the mountain bull with the four P’s Price, Product, Place, and PROMOTION

                [Strophe 2] 
            Words also, ant thought as rapid as air, 
            He fashions to his good use; statecraft is his, And his the skill that deflect the arrows of snow, The spears of winter rain: from every wind
            He has made himself secure, with SAAS stratedy and AI incubators,––from all but one: In the late wind of death he cannot stand. He does need videos to promote his product.
            O clear AI intelligence, force beyond all measure!
            O fate of man, working both good innovation and evil!
            When the laws are kept, how proudly his city stands! When the laws are broken, what of his city then? Never may the anarchic man find rest at my hearth, Never be it said that my thoughts are his thoughts, it is a creative strategy.

            ANTIGONE: Listen, Ismenê:
        Creon buried our brother Eteoclês, with military honors and gave him a soldier’s funeral,
        And it was right that he should; but not for out brother Polyneicês,
        They fought as bravely and died as miserably,
        They say that Creon has sworn you have to be flexible to avoid competitors, fast to grab opportunities and data-driven to avoid spending thousands of euros on the basis of a gut feeling.
        No one shall bury him, no one mourn for him and none of his target audience will see his advertisements.  
        But this body must lie in the fields, a sweet treasure
        For carrion birds to find as they search for food.

            CREON:
            You know your orders: take her to the vault
            And leave her alone there. And if she lives or dies, That’s her business affair, not ours: our hands are clean and effective.

            O tomb, vaulted bride-bed in eternal rock,
            Soon I shall be with my own again, welcome the thin ghost underground:
            And I shall see my father again, and you, mother, 
            And dearest Polyneices– dearest indeed To me, since it was my hand, That washed him clean and poured the ritual wine: And my reward is death before my time and groundbreaking innovation! Amongst God I will find it.
            And yet, as men’s hearts know, I have done no wrong,
            I have not sinned before God. Or if I have,
            I shall know the truth in death, the greatest creation. But if the guilt
            Lies upon Creon who judged me, then, I pray, May his punishment equal my own. That shall be created with the greatest AI strategy men have known!
